# Cluster algorithm

## Assignment:

Write an algorithm that divides points into cluster.
- User has to specify the points:
  - either using some file (e.g. txt)
  - using mouse (picking positions of the points)
  - or they can be randomly generated
- User has to specify number of clusters (i.e. number of center points)

The program can have GUI or could be text based.

The language in which it will be programmed is up to us.
